I am a Postdoctoral Associate affiliated with the [Center for the Study of American Politics](http://csap.yale.edu/) and the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I received a Ph.D. in political science from [Columbia University](http://polisci.columbia.edu/) in 2015. 

I study the politics of racial representation, the politics of discrimination and intergroup relations, and the formation of preferences toward racial and group-centric public policies. My research uses a combination of experimental, observational, and qualitative methods to measure individual- and group-level experiences and to answer questions at the intersection of racial and ethnic politics, political behavior, political psychology, political communication, and public policy.

My research examines how people with racial and partisan commitments form preferences over political strategies to advance racial representation (such as in the context of redistricting or party-building) when the strategies involve trade-offs between these commitments.  Building on this line of inquiry, my work also examines whether preferences toward costly strategies to advance racial representation vary by the relative intensities of one’s racial and partisan commitments, particularly among elites with strong group commitments; whether political arguments that invoke symbolic and instrumental appeals to value one set of commitments over the other affect preferences over political strategies; and whether perceived intragroup and intergroup contexts affect individuals’ preferences toward these strategies and the willingness of minorities to discuss and engage in political coordination on these strategies. This line of research, which I am also developing into a book project, demonstrates how racial minorities and racial liberals confronting these trade-offs think strategically about racial representation in the contemporary American political context in which parties are ideologically and racially polarized.

Other ongoing and recent projects evaluate how district context shapes minorities' expectations of representational quality in "minority-influence" districts; how the election of minority politicians affect downstream intergroup electoral dynamics and representational outcomes; whether government interventions to curb discriminatory market behavior is effective and why; how political and institutional contexts shape the decision of perceived targets of discrimination to choose over alternative avenues of recourse; and how perceptions of deservingness shape attitudes toward social insurance programs and beneficiaries. 

My research has been published or is forthcoming in _Political Psychology_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, _American Politics Research_, and _PLOS One_. My work has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation.

Before graduate school, I was a policy analyst at a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization evaluating social policy programs and labor market interventions targeting low-wage workers and communities.
