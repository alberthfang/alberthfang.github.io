I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Center for the Study of American Politics](http://csap.yale.edu/) and the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I received my PhD in political science from Columbia University in 2015.

I conduct research at the intersection of racial and ethnic politics, political behavior, representation, public policy, and experimental methods. 

My research focuses on how individuals' attitudes and behavior regarding racial politics and interracial relations are shaped by their social identities and political contexts. I explore these relationships in two domains central to modern-day American racial politics and public policy: (1) how descriptive representation distinctly matters, independently from partisan representation, as a strategy to advance racial representation when party and race are correlated, and (2) the political economy of race and discrimination, specifically the conditions under which government and social interventions to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination are effective and why. 

My work is published, forthcoming, or conditionally accepted at peer-reviewed outlets---including _The Journal of Politics_, _Political Psychology_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, _American Politics Research_, and _PLOS ONE_---and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation.

Prior to graduate school, I worked in social policy research analyzing the impact of anti-poverty programs.
