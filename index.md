I am a postdoctoral associate in the [Center for the Study of American Politics](https://csap.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), where I conduct research at the intersection of political psychology, political behavior, identity politics (race, ethnicity, and gender), and the politics of public policy and law.

I study identity in the context of representation and accountability. My research agenda focuses on how members of underrepresented groups (such as racial minorities and women) form political preferences and how public policies and elite behavior affect the welfare of these groups. To investigate these questions, my work combines multi-method strategies to measure the lived experiences of these groups with innovative experimental and quasi-experimental research designs.

My [job market paper](research/tradeoffs_paper.pdf) uses original data from a large, nationally representative survey of Black, Latino, and Asian Americans and a novel experimental design to examine how cross-pressured racial minorities navigate trade-offs between their racial and partisan group interests to form preferences about how to allocate institutional power across racial and partisan groups in the redistricting process. I uncover compelling evidence that cross-pressured minorities are willing to forgo increasing descriptive representation via the creation of majority-minority districts if doing so decreases Democratic power in legislatures.

Other current and recent projects examine:
* how minorities navigate similar tensions between their racial and partisan interests in other choice contexts;
* how norm and informational interventions by states, political elites, and social campaigns affect political attitudes and behavior toward marginalized groups; and
* how expectations of bias shape the political preferences and behavior of marginalized groups across electoral, bureaucratic, and legal settings.

My work has been published in _The Journal of Politics_, _Political Psychology_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, and _American Politics Research_, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation as well as grants at Yale and Columbia.

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from [Columbia University](https://polisci.columbia.edu/) and a B.A. in Political Science from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). Prior to graduate studies, I worked in social policy impact evaluation analyzing the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs, community development programs, and educational policy interventions in the United States.
