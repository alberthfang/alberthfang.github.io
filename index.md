I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for the Study of American Politics and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Yale University.<br /><br />

My primary research interests are in political behavior; political psychology; race, ethnicity, and identity politics; and survey and experimental methods.<br /><br />

I use experimental and quantitative methods to study the politics of racial representation, the political economy of race relations and civil rights, and the politics of public policy in the United States.<br /><br />

My work is published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals including _The Journal of Politics_, _Political Psychology_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, and _American Politics Research_, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation and the Yale Women Faculty Forum.<br /><br />

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.
