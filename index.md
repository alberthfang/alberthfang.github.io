I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Center for the Study of American Politics](http://csap.yale.edu/) and the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I received my PhD in political science from Columbia University in 2015.

My research broadly lies at the intersection of racial and ethnic politics, political behavior, representation, and public policy. Using a combination of experimental, statistical, and qualitative methods, my research agenda broadly investigates the political dynamics of racial representation and intergroup relations in contemporary American politics.

My current work examines the formation of mass preferences for strategies to advance racial representation that incur political trade-offs, how the politics of descriptive representation varies across electoral and intergroup contexts, and the conditions under which state and non-state interventions to improve intergroup relations are effective. I also conduct experimental research in political behavior, political psychology, and public opinion.

My research is published, forthcoming, or conditionally accepted at The Journal of Politics, Political Psychology, Political Science Research and Methods, American Politics Research, and PLOS ONE. My work has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation.
