<p class="indexfont">I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for the Study of American Politics and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Yale University.</p>

<p class="indexfont">My primary research interests are in political behavior; political psychology; race, ethnicity, and identity politics; and experimental methods.</p>

<p class="indexfont">I use experimental and quantitative methods to study the politics of racial representation, the political economy of race relations and civil rights, and the politics of public policy in the United States.</p>
