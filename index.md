I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [Center for the Study of American Politics](http://csap.yale.edu/) and the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/) at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/). I received my PhD in political science from Columbia University in 2015.

I conduct research at the intersection of racial and ethnic politics, political behavior, representation, public policy, and experimental methods. 

My research investigates how individuals' attitudes and behavior regarding racial politics and interracial relations are shaped by their social identities and political contexts. I explore these relationships in two domains central to contemporary racial politics and public policy in the United States: (1) how descriptive representation matters to racial representation above and beyond partisan representation and (2) whether government and social interventions designed to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination are effective and why.

My work is published, forthcoming, or conditionally accepted at peer-reviewed outlets---including The Journal of Politics, Political Psychology, Political Science Research and Methods, American Politics Research, and PLOS ONE---and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation.
