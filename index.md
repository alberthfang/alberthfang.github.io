I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu/), affiliated with the [Center for the Study of American Politics](http://csap.yale.edu/) and the [Institution for Social and Policy Studies](http://isps.yale.edu/). I received a Ph.D. in political science from [Columbia University](http://polisci.columbia.edu/) in 2015. 

I study American politics, political behavior, public opinion, representation, and racial and ethnic politics. My methodological interests include experimental methods and causal inference. My work is published or forthcoming at _Political Psychology_, _Political Science Research and Methods_, _American Politics Research_, and _PLOS ONE_, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation.

Before graduate school, I was a policy analyst at a nonpartisan nonprofit research organization evaluating social policy programs and labor market interventions targeting low-wage workers and communities.
