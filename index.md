I am a postdoctoral associate in the Center for the Study of American Politics at Yale University, where I conduct research at the intersection of political psychology, political behavior, identity politics (race, ethnicity, and gender), and the politics of public policy and law.<br /><br />

I study identity in the context of representation and accountability. My research agenda focuses on how members of underrepresented groups (such as racial minorities and women) form political preferences and how public policies and elite behavior affect the welfare of these groups. To investigate these questions, my work combines innovative research designs with the collection of large, original datasets measuring the lived experiences of these groups.<br /><br /> 

My job market paper uses a novel experimental design and data from over 2,400 Black, Latino, and Asian Americans to examine how cross-pressured racial minorities with overlapping racial and partisan identities navigate trade-offs between their partisan and racial group interests.<br /><br />

Other current and recent projects examine:
<ul>
<li>how minorities navigate similar tensions between their racial and partisan interests across a range of domains and implications for minority representation and party development; </li>
<li>how norm and informational interventions by states, political elites, and social campaigns affect political attitudes and behavior toward marginalized groups; and</li>
<li>how expectations of bias shape the political preferences and behavior of marginalized groups across electoral and bureaucratic settings.</li>
</ul>

My work is published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals including <i>The Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Psychology</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, and <i>American Politics Research</i>, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation as well as internal research grants at Yale and Columbia.<br /><br />

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.
