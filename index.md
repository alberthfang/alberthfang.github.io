I am a postdoctoral associate in the Center for the Study of American Politics at Yale University, where I conduct research in political psychology, political behavior, and identity politics.<br /><br />

I study identity in the context of representation and accountability. My research agenda focuses on how members of underrepresented groups (namely racial minorities and women) with overlapping social and partisan identities form political preferences and how public policies and elite behavior affect the welfare of underrepresented and marginalized groups. To investigate these questions, my work combines innovative research designs with the collection of large, original datasets measuring the lived experiences of these underrepresented groups.<br /><br /> 

My job market paper uses a novel experimental design and data from over 2,400 Black, Latino, and Asian Americans to examine how cross-pressured racial minorities with overlapping racial and partisan identities navigate trade-offs between their partisan and racial group interests when their preferences for greater descriptive racial representation and greater Democratic representation come into conflict in racial redistricting contexts.<br /><br />

Other current and recent projects investigate how expectations of bias shape the political preferences and behavior of marginalized groups across electoral and bureaucratic settings and how norm and informational interventions affect political attitudes and behavior toward marginalized groups.<br /><br />

My work is published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals including <i>The Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Psychology</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, and <i>American Politics Research</i>, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation as well as internal research grants at Yale and Columbia.<br /><br />

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.
