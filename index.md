I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for the Study of American Politics and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Yale University.<br /><br />

I use quantitative and experimental methods to study the politics of racial representation and the political economy of bias, discrimination, and inequality in the United States.<br /><br />

My work is published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals including <i>The Journal of Politics</i>, <i>Political Psychology</i>, <i>Political Science Research and Methods</i>, and <i>American Politics Research</i>, and has been funded by the Russell Sage Foundation and the Yale Women Faculty Forum.<br /><br />

I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University and a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.
