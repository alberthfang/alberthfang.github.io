I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Center for the Study of American Politics and the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at Yale University.

My primary research interests are in political behavior; political psychology; race, ethnicity, and identity politics; and experimental methods.
