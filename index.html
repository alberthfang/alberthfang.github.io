<hr />
<p>My research sits at the intersection of behavioral science, social and political psychology, political economy, and public policy. My methodological interests include experimentation, causal inference, machine learning, applied statistics, and survey methodology.<br /><br />I am a postdoctoral associate at the Center for the Study of American Politics at Yale University. I received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University and completed my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. In June 2019, I will be starting as a Behavioral Scientist at Zillow Research.</p>
