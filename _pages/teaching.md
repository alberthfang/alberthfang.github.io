I am prepared to teach undergraduate and graduate level courses in American politics, political behavior, political psychology, political representation, racial and ethnic politics, public opinion, public policy, experimental methods, causal inference, quantitative methods, and research design. My teaching statement and a summary of my teaching evaluations are available upon request. 

## At Yale University (as Instructor)
<ul>
<li> Group Processes and Intergroup Relations in American Politics (undergraduate seminar) -- scheduled for Spring 2018

<p class="notice--primary">This seminar considers the role of groups and intergroup relations in American politics, and is organized into two parts. The first part of the seminar draws on scholarship from political science, psychology, economics, and sociology to explore foundational concepts, theories, and debates in the study of how group processes shape political identity, political attitudes, and political behavior. The second part of the seminar delves deeper into research and ongoing scholarly debates on how groups shape American politics in selected domains, including political discourse and deliberation, collective action, candidate evaluations in electoral campaigns, political representation, and political and policy development.</p>
