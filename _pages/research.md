My research examines how individuals' attitudes and behavior regarding racial politics and intergroup relations are shaped by their social identities and by their political and institutional contexts. 

I explore these relationships in two domains central to modern-day American racial politics and public policy: (1) how descriptive representation distinctly matters, independently from partisan representation, as a strategy to advance racial representation when party and race are correlated, and (2) the political economy of race and discrimination, specifically the conditions under which government and social interventions to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination are effective and why. 

**How Descriptive Representation Matters for Racial Representation**

Party and race are highly correlated in the modern-day American political system where the two major political parties are polarized both ideologically and racially. Scholars have shown that this holds not only for Blacks but increasingly also for Latinos and Asians as well. In this context, there is need to interrogate canonical theories about the political importance of descriptive representation as a strategy to advance racial representation. The first stream of my research program addresses this need by examining the conditions under which descriptive representation uniquely matters -- above and beyond partisan representation -- to advance the representational goals of underrepresented racial minority groups. This line of research contributes to two ongoing debates in the study of descriptive representation, specifically about its political demand and its policy effects.

_Selected Projects:_

* How Symbolic and Instrumental Appeals Affect Preferences for Contentious Strategies to Advance Racial Representation 
* How District Context Shapes Mass Expectations of the Quality of Racial Representation in Plurality-Minority Districts 
* The Strategic and Symbolic Politics of Racial Representation (book project, in progress)

**The Politics of Discrimination and Intergroup Relations**

My second stream of research studies the conditions under which government and social interventions designed to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination are effective and why, and explores broader implications for the political economy of race, the politics of enforcing laws and norms against discrimination, and the development of racial orders. 

_Selected Projects:_

* Navigating Alternative Avenues of Recourse: How Political and Institutional Contexts Shape Behavioral Responses to Discrimination in the United States

* Gender Discrimination in Housing: Evidence from a Field Experiment (with Andrew Guess and Macartan Humphreys)
* Coethnicity, Context, and Racially Discriminatory Behavior in Market Transactions (with Andrew Guess and Macartan Humphreys)

**Experimental Research and Methods**

Beyond my core research agenda in racial politics and policy in the United States, I have a deep interest in the application of experimental methods and causal inference to answer substantive questions in political behavior, political psychology, and the politics of public policy. I also conduct research on methodological challenges to inference in experimental and observational studies; these projects have grown out of challenges that have arisen in my own substantive research.
