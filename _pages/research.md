My research examines how individuals' attitudes and behavior regarding racial politics and intergroup relations are shaped by their social identities and by their political and institutional contexts. 

I explore these relationships in two domains central to modern-day American racial politics and public policy: (1) how descriptive representation distinctly matters, independently from partisan representation, as a strategy to advance racial representation when party and race are correlated, and (2) the political economy of race and discrimination, specifically the conditions under which government and social interventions to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination are effective and why. 

**How Descriptive Representation Matters for Racial Representation**

Party and race are highly correlated in the modern-day American political system where the two major political parties are polarized both ideologically and racially. Scholars have shown that this holds not only for Blacks but increasingly also for Latinos and Asians as well. In this context, there is need to interrogate canonical theories about the political importance of descriptive representation as a strategy to advance racial representation. The first stream of my research program addresses this need by examining the conditions under which descriptive representation uniquely matters -- above and beyond partisan representation -- to advance the representational goals of underrepresented racial minority groups. This line of research contributes to two ongoing debates in the study of descriptive representation, specifically about its political demand and its policy effects.

_Selected Projects:_
* How Citizens Evaluate Trade-offs between Descriptive and Partisan Representation (job market paper)
* Do Minority Democrats Provide Better Minority Policy Representation than Non-Minority Democrats? A Design-Based Approach and Evidence from Latino Representation in the U.S. States
* Group Pressure and the Willingness to Discuss Contentious Political Strategies 
* How Symbolic and Instrumental Appeals Affect Preferences for Contentious Strategies to Advance Racial Representation 
* How District Context Shapes Mass Expectations of the Quality of Racial Representation in Plurality-Minority Districts 

Building on this work, I am developing a book project tentatively entitled _The Strategic and Symbolic Politics of Racial Representation_, which examines how minorities form preferences over conflicting symbolic and instrumental strategies to advance racial representation across a range of political domains, including racial redistricting, candidate selection in party primaries, elite messaging strategies, and policymaking. As part of this line of research, I am also investigating the conditions under which competing symbolic and instrumental appeals affect racial minoritiesâ€™ preferences over these strategies, how the importance of descriptive representation varies across electoral and intergroup contexts, and how group pressures affect deliberation within minority communities about which strategies should be pursued. Data collection for these extensions is currently in progress. Taken together, this body of work addresses the need to question naive interpretations of minority politics as symbolic politics, to understand how citizens with multiple political identities and group commitments navigate trade-offs between their commitments when they come into conflict, to investigate the conditions under which racial minorities choose to engage in sophisticated and strategic political thinking and behavior, and to understand the implications of these choices for the development of racial politics and party politics in the contemporary United States.

**The Politics of Discrimination and Intergroup Relations**

Under what conditions are government and social interventions designed to reduce racial prejudice and discrimination effective and why? In addition to understanding the effects of interventions in real world settings, my work investigates the psychological processes that explain attitudinal and behavioral outcomes; employs novel measurement strategies and experimental designs to identify substantive quantities of interest; and explores broader implications for the political economy of race, the politics surrounding the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws and norms, and the development of racial orders.

**Experimental Research and Political Methodology**

Beyond my core research program in racial politics and policy in the United States, I have a deep interest in the application of experimental methods and causal inference to answer substantive questions in political behavior, political psychology, and the politics of public policy. I also conduct research on methodological challenges to inference in experimental and observational studies; these projects have grown out of challenges that have arisen in my own substantive research.
